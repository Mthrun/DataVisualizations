Version 1.1.13 (GitHub, 2021-06-18)
	o Changed design choice in ParetoDensityEstimation(): If user sets kernels incorrectly, intead of correcting kernels, the density is now estimated incorrectly and a warning is given back.
	o Bugfix ParetoDensityEstimation() for big data with high peaks: sometimes the pareto radius is estimated too small if data size is above 10e5 because sample size for pareto radius estimation gets below 10 percent. In this case, not all data points lie within a pareto radius and the density is not estimated correctly. To fix this: Instead of one sample, multiple samples are taken in this case to estimate an average pareto radius.
	o Improvements: MD-plot now allows the possiblity to force non-conventional names of columns at the risk that plotting may not work correctly. Moreover the boolean BW can be set to switch between the visualization on the screen and an automatic black and white background for paper. Additionaly, the centered title of the plot and ylabel can be set swiftly.
	o Improvements: Serveral function now show the name(s) of variable(s) per default as xlabel and ylabel
	o Improvements: MA-plot provides now optionally confidence intervalls and limits of agreement and user either Classplot or DensityScatter
	o Standardized Output of DensityScatter using captial X and captial Y instead of x and y
	o Bugfix Classplot(): plots the colors of the points now correctly for Plotter="native" 
	
Version 1.2.2 (CRAN, 2021-01-12)
	o Bugfix of ClassNames for ClassMDplot
	o ParetoRadius now checks suggested namespace and falls back if package does not exist instead of getting an error
	o ParetoDensityEstimation now checks suggested namespace and falls back to R base if package does not exist instead of getting an error
	o Namespaces fallbacks or bugfixes in case that suggested packages are not installed for the following functions:  ABCbarplot, Choroplethmap, Classplot, DensityScatter, DualaxisLinechart, Fanplot, GoogleMapsCoordinates, Heatmap, InspectDistances, MDplot, PDEscatter, Silhouetteplot, Worldmap, zplot
	
Version 1.2.1 (CRAN, 2020-10-27)
	o Major Bugifx for MDplot, we forgot to disable horizontal jittering of points priorly, this is fixed now.
	o Reimplemented ClassMDplot based on the published version of the MDplot. Violins do not have a color depending on the class yet, because we do not know how to implement this feature at the moment.
	o Stale sp data objects of wolrd_copuntry_polygons.rda were rebuild and updated using new sp package.
	
Version 1.2.0 (CRAN, 2020-08-04)
	o Standardized Output of PDEscatter
	o Introduced SmoothedDensitiesXY for a very fast density estimation in case of large two-dimensional datasets.
	o Generalized PDEscatter to a new function called DensityScatter with the two density estimation options PDE and SDH.
	o Renamed ShepardPDEScatter to ShepardDensityScatter using "SDH" density estimation.
	o InspectCorrelation added as shortcut to inspect correlations.
	o Heatmap: Due to scientific reviews, documentation is elaborated and visualisation is now clearer.
	o bugfixes MDplot: multiple missing column names declared as "" can now be plotted; disabled for R 4.0.x manual jittering as geom_jitter does it now properly; RobustGaussian=TRUE now does not give the warning "Computation failed in `stat_ydensity()`:replacement has 1 row, data has 0"  which priorly sometimes was written in console and was irritating because density estimation was always properly performed.

Version 1.1.13 (GitHub, 2020-06-17)
	o Fanplot and pieChart colors are defined by length of labels.
	o PDEscatter: Implemented several error catches and enabled two options of drawing a sample depending on the size of data.
	o Classplot: Implemented several error catches and fixed bug in case of NaN values and given Names.

Version 1.1.12 (CRAN, 2020-05-10)
	o Bugfix MDplot for Ordering Bimodal in BimodalityAmplitude and improved nameing for two input parameters for MDplot.
	o Improvement Classplot: ggplot2 added and if names exist, a switch to ggplot is taken per default because overlapping in long names can be avoided there.

Version 1.1.11 (GitHub, 2020-03-02)
	o Improvement of efficiency of ParetoDensityFunction using Rcpp by reducing computing time around 80 percent. Improvement is passed on to MDplot.
	o Classplot: Missing values can be now removed with na-rm=TRUE, fixed feature checks, LineColor is now per default invisible in this dot plot, Names for points and size of points can be set optionally (in case of using this plot to visualise a Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) with/without its curve).
	o bugfix: Heatmap and InspectDistances: using unname in isSymmetric to check correctly of symmetric distance matrix.
	o bugfix: PDEplot y-axis should always start with zero because this functions plots the density.
	o bugfix: SignedLog besides strings, now also accepts numerical values correctly for the Base argument.
	o bugfix: Fanplot and Piechart now labels <0.01% correctly.
	o bugfix: ParetoDensityEstimation ensures now that all data is contained in a Pareto ball even if pretty does not set the breaks from min to max. This resulted priorly in an incorrect density estimation in the special case of more than one mode of data with one mode consisting of unique data points lying exactly on on of the two borders of data (either min or max) in the case of an existing empty space between the unique values and the other mode of data.
	o BimodalityAmplitude enables to order the MDplot using the bimodality coefficient of [Zhang, 2003] using the PDE.

Version 1.1.11 (CRAN, 2020-02-13)
	o Bugfix: Missing rgl packages in solaris combined with a CRAN check of Plot3D does not allow the package to install itself
	o CombineCols: Robust alternative to \code{\link{cbind}} that fills missing values with nan instead of extending length of vector by duplicating elements

Version 1.1.10 (CRAN, 2020-02-02)
	o DualaxisLinechart works now in combination with plotly::subplot ommitting the bug of subplot, see https://github.com/ropensci/plotly/issues/954
	o MDplot has now two new sorting options for columns: increasing average or variance, or decreasing bimodality (using packages modes).
	o Bugfix: MDplot bug fixed in case of two columns of which one is only NaN and in case of jittered not-finite values.
	o Bugfix: ParetoDensityEstimationV2 bug for data with only two unique values fixed.
	o Bugfix: MDplot4multiplevectors: rowr is depricated, hence the relevant function is internally integrated now in MDplot4multiplevectors
	o Naming Convention: delted V2 in ParetoDensityEstimation, ParetoRadius and OptimalNoBins because these functions are now completly removed from the AdaptGauss package.

Version 1.1.9 (CRAN, 2019-11-10)
	o Improvements in ClassMDplot in the case of Big Data (e.g. Flow Cytometry data of CLL)
	o bugfix ABCbarplot: x-axis shows now correct prozentual values between 1 and 100.
	o Pixelmatrix is now significantly fast by using geom_raster instead of geom_tile.
	o Bugfix MDplot: Several whitespread unique values in large data vectors are visualized correctly. Option "RobustGaussian=TRUE" now works also if only one column of data is given as input.
	o Bugfix ParetoDensityEstimationV2: Assumes now the dirac delta distribution for one ore two unique values in a given vector of data of arbitrary length.
	o All density estimation based function are now faster because Rcpp is used for the bottleneck stats function.
	o zplot: Changed interpolation from akima to MBA due to licensing issues with akima, see https://www.user2017.brussels/uploads/bivand_gebhardt_user17_a0.pdf
	o Bugfix MDplot: Blanks in colnames are caught and replaced by numbers.

	o Improvement: ClassMDplot now jitters points instead of visualizing pdf if not enough data in class is given.
	o Bugfix: In Heatmap the x labels are now plotted correctly.
	o Bugfix: In ClassMDplot class names now work correctly.
	o Classplot and DualClassplot: Functions allow to plot one or two time series with a classification as scatter plots or line and scatter plots. Usefull to see if temporal clustering has time dependent variations and for Hidden Markov Models (see Mthrun/RHmm on GitHub).
	
Version 1.1.5 (CRAN, 2019-02-02)
	o Bugfix: The statistical testing in the MD-plot now is omitted if not enough unique values are given in some features. In such a case, only a scatter plot is plotted.
	o Naming Convention: Standardized plotting functions by removing "plot" in names except cases where it is conventional in other sources, e.g. MAplot. Older function names will be removed in the next CRAN version.
