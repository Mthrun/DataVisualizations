Version 1.1.5 (CRAN, 2018-02-02)
	o Bugfix: The statistical testing in the MD-plot now is omitted if not enough unique values are given in some features. In such a case, only a scatter plot is plotted.
	o Naming Convention: Standardized plotting functions by removing "plot" in names except cases where it is conventional in other sources, e.g. MAplot. Older function names will be removed in the next CRAN version.
						o  plotWorldmap renamed to Worldmap
						o  plotChoroplethMap renamed to Choroplethmap
						o  ClassBoxPlot renamed to ClassBoxplot
						o  ClassViolinPlot renamed to ClassViolin
						o  fanPlot renamed to Fanplot
						o  pieChart renamed to Piechart
						o  CrossTablePlot renamed to Crosstable
						o  slopeChart renamed to Slopechart
						o  plot3D renamed to Plot3D
						o  InspectScatterOfData renamed to InspectScatterplots
						o  PixelMatrixPlot renamed to Pixelmatrix
						o  ShepardScatterPlot renamed to Sheparddiagram
						o  ShepardDensityPlot renamed to ShepardPDEscatter
						o  DualAxisLineChart renamed to DualaxisLinechart
						o  SilhouettePlot renamed to Silhouetteplot
						o  BoxplotData renamed to InspectBoxplots
						o  QQplotWithFit renamed to QQplot
	o nanPlot is deprecated. The new function is PlotMissingvalues

Version 1.1.4 (GitHub, 2018-11-17)
	o SignedLog: Allows to transform negativ values with logarithm.
	o Improvement: MD-plot allows for Scaling and Ordering of data and plots scattered points if a column has not enough values to perform density estimation.
	o Bugfix: stat_pde_density now works  for only one value if other values are NaN.
	
Version 1.1.4 (CRAN, 2018-10-21)
	o DualAxisLineChart enables to visualize to lines in one plot overlaying them using ploty (e.g. two time series with two ranges of values)
	o Bugfix: PDEscatter now removes non-numeric values with na.rm=TRUE before xlim and ylim are defined
	o ProductRatioPlot: The plot is useful in the case where there are many instances of very small values, but a small number of very large ones
	o CrossTablePlot: Presents a heatmap with values and a cross table of given Data matrix of two features and a bin width or percentualized values
	o Update: plot3D function and documentation improved.
	
Version 1.1.3 (GitHub, 2018-07-07)
	o Improvement: MD-plot layout changes and plotting paramater added.
	o InspectCorrelation now visualizes the density and calcluates the spearman correlation index as a shortcut to PDEscatter.
	o Minor bugifx: MD-plot now uses ggExtra::rotateTextX() for better xaxis alignment of text.
	
Version 1.1.2 (GitHub, 2018-07-02)
	o Bugfix: InspectDistances methods argument now passed on to parallelDist::parDist.

Version 1.1.1 (CRAN 2018-06-30)
	o Improved visualization of MD-plot.
	
Version 1.1.0 (GitHub)
    o Vignette generated.
	o Bugfix: authors stated in Description regarding functions which were used in other dbt packages instead of this package.
	
Version 1.0.9 (GitHub)
    o ClassViolinPlot build on top of stat_pde_density for Data with Clustering.
    o Bugfix in stat_pde_density for special case of one value.
	o parallelDist integrated for faster distance computations.
	
Version 1.0.8 (GitHub)
    o Bugfix in stat_pde_density for special case of one value.
	o Minor bugfix in PDEscatter.
	
Version 1.0.7 (GitHub)
    o MD-plot: stat_pde_density added in order to integrate concept with ggplot2.

Version 1.0.1-1.0.6 (GitHub)
    o ClassBoxPlot function added for Data with Clustering.
	o ClassPDEplot function added for Data with Clustering.
	o ClassPDEplotMaxLikeli function added for Data with Clustering.
	o Minor bugfix in InspectVariable function.
	o Bugfix in internpiechart.

Version 1.0.0 (CRAN, 2018-05-06)
    o Complete package generated.
