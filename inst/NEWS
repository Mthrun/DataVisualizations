Version 1.1.7 (GitHub, 2018-04-17)
o Bugfix: In MD-plot Jitter Plot for colomuns with one unique value, in the case it is zero, corrected.
o Bugfix: In MD-plot statistical cases for colomuns with one unique value but more than 45000 cases corrected.
o Bugfix: In MD-plot does not crash anymore if columns exists with not one finite values but data has more cases than the sample size.
o Bugfix: Namespace of AdaptGauss package added for Pareto density estimation
Version 1.1.6 (CRAN, 2018-03-08)
	o Major Improvement: The MD-plot samples now data automatically above an threshold in order to be usuable for Big Data.
	o Bugfixes: In MD-plot the testing against uniform distribution now works also for one feauture. A crash is fixed where a columns has not even one finite value.
	o Bugfix: If colnames of Data are given in MD-plot but not unique, they are renamed to unique colnames.
	o Bugfix: Plot3D checks now that the length of Cls is equal to the number of rows of data.
	o Bugfix: ClassPDEplot did not plot all pdfs for SameKernelsAndRadius=0.
	o Improvement: ClassMDplot now jitters points instead of visualizing pdf if not enough data in class is given.
	o Bugfix: In Heatmap the x labels are now plotted correctly.
	o Bugfix: In ClassMDplot class names now work correctly.
	o Classplot and DualClassplot: Functions allow to plot one or two time series with a classification as scatter plots or line and scatter plots. Usefull to see if temporal clustering has time dependent variations and for Hidden Markov Models (see Mthrun/RHmm on GitHub).
	
Version 1.1.5 (CRAN, 2018-02-02)
	o Bugfix: The statistical testing in the MD-plot now is omitted if not enough unique values are given in some features. In such a case, only a scatter plot is plotted.
	o Naming Convention: Standardized plotting functions by removing "plot" in names except cases where it is conventional in other sources, e.g. MAplot. Older function names will be removed in the next CRAN version.
						o  plotWorldmap renamed to Worldmap
						o  plotChoroplethMap renamed to Choroplethmap
						o  ClassBoxPlot renamed to ClassBoxplot
						o  fanPlot renamed to Fanplot
						o  pieChart renamed to Piechart
						o  CrossTablePlot renamed to Crosstable
						o  slopeChart renamed to Slopechart
						o  plot3D renamed to Plot3D
						o  InspectScatterOfData renamed to InspectScatterplots
						o  PixelMatrixPlot renamed to Pixelmatrix
						o  ShepardScatterPlot renamed to Sheparddiagram
						o  ShepardDensityPlot renamed to ShepardPDEscatter
						o  DualAxisLineChart renamed to DualaxisLinechart
						o  SilhouettePlot renamed to Silhouetteplot
						o  BoxplotData renamed to InspectBoxplots
						o  QQplotWithFit renamed to QQplot
	o nanPlot is deprecated. The new function is PlotMissingvalues.
	o ClassViolinPlot is deprecated. The new function is ClassMDplot.

Version 1.1.4 (GitHub, 2018-11-17)
	o SignedLog: Allows to transform negativ values with logarithm.
	o Improvement: MD-plot allows for Scaling and Ordering of data and plots scattered points if a column has not enough values to perform density estimation.
	o Bugfix: stat_pde_density now works  for only one value if other values are NaN.
	
Version 1.1.4 (CRAN, 2018-10-21)
	o DualAxisLineChart enables to visualize to lines in one plot overlaying them using ploty (e.g. two time series with two ranges of values)
	o Bugfix: PDEscatter now removes non-numeric values with na.rm=TRUE before xlim and ylim are defined
	o ProductRatioPlot: The plot is useful in the case where there are many instances of very small values, but a small number of very large ones
	o CrossTablePlot: Presents a heatmap with values and a cross table of given Data matrix of two features and a bin width or percentualized values
	o Update: plot3D function and documentation improved.
	
Version 1.1.3 (GitHub, 2018-07-07)
	o Improvement: MD-plot layout changes and plotting paramater added.
	o InspectCorrelation now visualizes the density and calcluates the spearman correlation index as a shortcut to PDEscatter.
	o Minor bugifx: MD-plot now uses ggExtra::rotateTextX() for better xaxis alignment of text.
	
Version 1.1.2 (GitHub, 2018-07-02)
	o Bugfix: InspectDistances methods argument now passed on to parallelDist::parDist.

Version 1.1.1 (CRAN 2018-06-30)
	o Improved visualization of MD-plot.
	
Version 1.1.0 (GitHub)
    o Vignette generated.
	o Bugfix: authors stated in Description regarding functions which were used in other dbt packages instead of this package.
	
Version 1.0.9 (GitHub)
    o ClassViolinPlot build on top of stat_pde_density for Data with Clustering.
    o Bugfix in stat_pde_density for special case of one value.
	o parallelDist integrated for faster distance computations.
	
Version 1.0.8 (GitHub)
    o Bugfix in stat_pde_density for special case of one value.
	o Minor bugfix in PDEscatter.
	
Version 1.0.7 (GitHub)
    o MD-plot: stat_pde_density added in order to integrate concept with ggplot2.
