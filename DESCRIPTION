Description: A collection of various visualizations methods is provided. With regards to high-dimensional data the heat map and silhouette plot for grouped data,visualizations of the distribution of distances, the scatter-density plot for two variables,the Shepard density plot as well as the Bland-Altman plot are presented here. For a classification of countries, a map of the world or Germany can be visualized. 'DataVisualizations' makes it possible to inspect the distribution of each feature of a dataset visually through the combination of four methods.More detailed explanations can be found in the book of Thrun, M.C.:"Projection-Based Clustering through Self-Organization and Swarm Intelligence" (2018) <DOI:10.1007/978-3-658-20540-9>. Furthermore, for categorical features the ABCanalysis improved Pie charts, slope charts and fan plots are usable. Additionally, for measurements across a geographic area an easy to use function for a Choropleth map is presented here.
